Independent Study Fall 2018.

The brain is constantly changing, and as such, the activity of neurons changes over time.  While adaptive decoding methods aim to account for such temporal changes, we know relatively little about their nature and how change differs across recording modalities. Understanding such temporal changes could be significant in revealing important insight into neuroscience as well as in the development of medical devices, such as brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that may restore normal neurological function to impaired individuals. Using time as a parameter in machine learning decoding methods allows us to model the time-dependent changes occurring in the brain. Here, we apply machine learning techniques to decode neural spiking activity in the auditory cortex, with and without using time as a parameter, and compare the results to those obtained from other modalities. By comparing the predictive ability of these methods, we have found no significant difference between decoding accuracies with and without the inclusion of time as a parameter, indicative of no conclusive improvement in the efficacy of machine learning decoders when accounting for temporal changes in the brain.
